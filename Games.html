				<h3>Description</h3>
				<h3>(Games only work on PC)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class = "desText">Pong - (2 Player Game) Go against your opponent and hit the ball
							into their score. This the normal game Pong but with a twist. Fruit will
							summon every once in awhile. The fruit will either boost you or deboost 
							your opponent. <br> Credits: Images made by Levi Snyder, Sounds made by Levi 
							Snyder, Concept made by Levi Snyder, Code made by Levi Snyder.
						</li>
					
						<li class = "desText">Out of Breath - (1 Player Game) You play a girl named Mack. She fell
							out of her submarine while going to do research on why the sea creatures are becoming super hostile.
							She landed miles away form the drop site. Having to hurry on and put on her suit she didn't have time
							to make sure she had enought oxygen. Now you must find away to be reunited with the sub before your oxygen 
							runs out and you die. <br> Credits: General Images made by Levi Snyder, Mack image made by Okomi. Sounds made by 
							Levi Snyder, Concept made by Levi Snyder, Code made by Levi Snyder.
						</li>
						
						<li class = "desText">MicroKart Game - (1 Player Game) You drive a GoKart around the track to collect all of the hoops
							in under 60 seconds. Credits: All credits go to Unity's microgames. All I did was change the speed, cart, added a bushes, and color.

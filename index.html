				<h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>1. "Wild Axolotls are rarely white and pink. 
							They tend to be black and green-ish brown color" (Oconnel).
						</li>

						<li>2. "The dark pink things are actually the gills of 
							the Axolotls" (Oconnel).
						</li>

						<li>3. "Wild Axolotls can only be found in Xochimilco, Mexico" (Oconnel).
						</li>

						<li>4. "Axolotls are going extinct. There numbers keep going down, 
							there is only 700 to 1200 Axolotls in the wild. With pollution and 
							habitat loss they will soon be no more of them in the wild" (Oconnel).
						</li>
					
						<li>5. "Axolotls have super regeneration, they can regenerate there brains
							limbs almost every part of them can regenerate with no scars. 
							They will regenerate everything perfectly making it seem like it was never 
							gone" (Oconnel).

				<h2>Information:</h2>
					<p class = "mainText"> ""Ax-oh-lot-ul". Alt means "water" and xolotl means "dog". Putting the 
						words together means Water Dog. The Axolotl is actually involoved in the Aztec's 
						mythology. They are named after the Aztec deity Xolotl. Xolotl job was to protect
						the sun from the dangers of the underworld. Xolotl would become an Axolotl and guide the 
						dead on their journey to Mictlan the afterlife" ("Xolotl").</p>
			
					<p class = "mainText"> "A sexually mature adult Axolotl, at age 18-24 months, ranges in length
						from 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in), although a size close to 23 cm (9 in) is most common. 
						The wild population has been put under heavy pressure by the growth of Mexico City. 
						The axolotl is currently on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's annual 
						Red List of threatened species. Non-native fish, such as African tilapia and Asian carp, 
						have also recently been introduced to the waters. These new fish have been eating the axolotls' young, 
						as well as its primary source of food. The axolotl is carnivorous, consuming small prey such as worms, 
						insects, and small fish in the wild. Axolotls locate food by smell, and will "snap" at any potential 
						meal, sucking the food into their stomachs with vacuum force" ("Axolotl").
					</p>
			
					<p class = "mainText"> I have decided to add the Axolotl as a pet in one of my games called "Out of Breath".
						In the game "Out of Breath" the Axolotl's main ability is searching the seaweed for food. While searching for 
						food it will destroy the seaweed. The food it finds heal the Axolotl's health. If the player, Mack, is about 
						gets hurt from an living creature the Axolotl will swim at full speed to protect its friend. This will lead 
						to the Axolotl to get hurt. But due to it's regeneration abilities it heals a little bit of health every second.
						Don't tell the other pets but the Axolotl is my favorite pet.
